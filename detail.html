        <p class="m-1.5 p-4">Sayaji Baug, also known as Kamati Baug, is a massive green square in the middle of the town, which houses the
          famous Museum and Picture Gallery, and other kid-friendly sights like an aquarium, zoo, health museum,
          planetarium, a toy train and a flowerbed clock.</p>


        <p>The Baroda Museum & Picture Gallery is home to a diverse collection of art, much of it gathered by Maharaja
          Sayajirao III, including statues and carvings from several Asian regions, fine ivory carvings from India,
          Japan and China, a modest Egyptian room with a mummy and an entire floor of stuffed and pickled wildlife
          specimens.
        </p>


        <p>The gallery has lovely Mughal miniatures and a motley crew of European masters. This is the largest public
          garden in the western part of the country, sprawled over 113 acres. Over 96 species of trees and a small zoo
          make this an interesting place for nature lovers.</p>
